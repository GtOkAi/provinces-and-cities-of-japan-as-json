# Provincies and Cities of Japan as JSON with Kanji and Romaji

After much research, I couldn't find a list of Japanese provinces and cities with names in both kanji and romaji, so I created one from other databases. If any errors are found in the translation of cities, please let me know.

## example:

    "cities": [
        {
            "id": "1000000",
            "ken": "北海道",
            "shi": "札幌市北区",
            "kenr": "Hokkaido",
            "shir": "Kita-ku,Sapporo"
        }],
    "provinces": [
        {
            "id": "1000",
            "cod": "1",
            "kenr": "Hokkaido",
            "ken": "北海道"
        }]
